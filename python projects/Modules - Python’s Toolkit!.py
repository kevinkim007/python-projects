# Modules - Python’s Toolkit! 🧰

# Python comes with a toolkit of modules—specialized code libraries that you can use without building everything from scratch. It’s like using a toolbox instead of crafting tools by hand! 🔨

# To use a module, just import it:

# 📝 Example 1: Math Module: For mathematical functions.

import math

# Using the math module to calculate the square root
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0


#Example 2: Random Module: For generating random numbers.

import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 6 (like rolling a die)
dice_roll = random.randint(1, 6)
print("You rolled a", dice_roll)


# Some popular modules:
# 🔹 math: For math operations.
# 🔹 random: For generating random numbers 🎲.
# 🔹 datetime: For working with dates and times ⏰.

# Modules help you get things done faster—like using ready-made gadgets!
